#  diceGameRemix - The Green Bottles Dice Game

This web site was created as part of Code Nation's Master Software Developer course. This was an assignment to show the skills we acquired regarding using javascript in functional websites, that I later adapted with ReactJS to improve the look and functionality.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
